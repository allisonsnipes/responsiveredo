          Hello there! So my name is Allison Juliette Snipes. If you notice my last name-you might think you know it from somewhere? SO STORYTIME! I am related to Wesley Snipes the famous protagonist from the Blade series. True story-I've never seen any of the Blade movies. But I do enjoy a vampire or a zombie flick now and then.

          I receive my Masters Degree from The University of San Francisco in Economics, and both of my Undergraduate Degrees from The University of South Carolina (for International Relations and Economics). I currently work in the government sector as an Human Resource Office of Workers' Compensation Specialist. I audit and adjudicate Workers' Compensation Claims for the Department of Veterans Affairs on behalf of the Department of Labor. I enjoy my work, and helping injured workers receive their benefits and process their claims. Well-until I find fradulent claims submitted by federal workers. Then my job is no longer happy-go-lucky, as I turn into the bad guy, and put on my investigator hat. I do not like that aspect of my job, but it is a nessessary part to keep all parties honest. I enrolled in UCBC to make a career transition to either a Backend Engineer, Software Engineer, or Full Stack Engineer.

          I am mostly self taught in my coding journey, with taking some coding classes. I mainly just inspected cool websites that I found, and read the various html, js, and css files. Eventually, I tried other bootcamps until I stumbled upon UCB program. Becoming a Full Stack Web Dev is not my end goal-hopefully I will acheive my goal of becoming a Cybersecurity professional. I have already begun the process of teaching myself how to perform certain penetration tests, hacking, social engineering, operate virtual machines, and have worked a bit with Kali Linux. I am looking forward to learning from Falisse, and studying with everyone.
